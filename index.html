            <h1>what is an "idea cloud"?</h1>
            <blockquote class="right">Hi there.<br /><br />ideacloud.us is intented as an idea-sharing platform. We want to link people with ideas to people who search some great ideas for realization...</blockquote>
            <p> An idea cloud should be a platform to bring two groups together: 
            </p>
			<ul>
				<li>First there shall be people who have ideas for some kind of tool or application or anything else. Additionally this group can be containing people who see the need of a specific application and are looking for help on a project. </li>
				<li>The second group shall be composed of people with practical experience who are searching for good ideas to work on them.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>ideacloud.us now shall be the platform for the initial exchange between these two groups. Therefore the first group can post their ideas and create a pool of various ideas - the so called idea cloud. 
			<br />
			This cloud contains user-generated content and is obviously using the cloud buzzword to get attention ;-) So to benefit from the also ongoing web 2.0 hype we call ourself ideacloud.us (beta)..
            </p>
            
            <h2>so, what are your further ideas for idea cloud?</h2>
			<p>Yeah, another good question. Some of our ideas are already in the system itself because we are looking for some kind of help too. But thinking strategic we need some of the following stuff:
			<br /></p>
			<ul> 
				<li>Apps for iOS, Android to support the creative process on mobile devices</li>
				<li>Opportunity to connect various ideas to one bigger idea</li>
				<li>Idea center for developer</li>
				<li>Re-Tagging of ideas</li>
				<li>Idea gallery for tracking implemented ideas</li>
				<li>Some kind of voodoo to match new ideas against existing idea to prevent duplicates</li>
				<li>Make the ideacloud installable on different servers for using it on a company's intranet without public access</li>
				<li>Rating of ideas</li>
			</ul>	
			<p>You see there is pretty much work ahead. Don't hesitate to contact us via the idea cloud if you want to help us. 
			<br />
			We tried hard to post all of our ideas at the system. See the contact page if you want to send us an email.</p>
		</article>

		<article id="functions">
			<h1>what functions do you offer?</h1>
			<p>Pretty simply speaking, we support three different use case now.	</p>
			<ul>
				<li>you can post your idea to the idea cloud and receive an unique idea id</li>
				<li>you can visit existing ideas through our web site and contact the id owner with your idea id you can visit the idea centre which contains collected feedbacks from other users</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>how can I post my ideas?</h2>
			<p>It's simple to post your ideas via our web form located on the left hand site of the page. There are some input fields to fill e.g. the name of the idea, some kind of description and your email address. Additionally you can tag your idea.
			<br />
			Maybe its helpful to have a look at the already used tags to get most
			attention you need for your idea.</p>

			<h2>what do I have to consider during my post?</h2>
			<p>Do not describe your idea to accurate. If you do so there can be no idea thievery prevention from the system. You better describe in general terms what’s your intention.</p>
			<ul> 
				<li>bad description:<br />
				I need an application for MacOSX 10.x that opens iCal every time i get an email via mail.app that contains an invitation. </li>
				<li>might be a better description: <br />
				I've got an idea for an application for MacOSX that helps organizing incoming meeting invites. </li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>bad description: <br/> 
				I've dreamed of a web application that is able to store ideas from users to connect them with developers or people who help them with the implementation. it should be called idea cloud and there should be a opportunity to enable communication between the two groups of people. </li>
				<li>might be a better description:<br />
				Need help on a new web application that should connect two different groups via its web interface. Contact me to learn more. Furthermore try to describe your idea as detailed as you could to get the most understanding for the reader. </li>
			</ul>

			<h2>what about privacy?</h2>
			<p>After posting an idea at our system you get a unique token id with which you can easily access the answers to your post at any time. Since this code doesn't contain any of your contact information you won't get spammed afterwards.
			<br /><br />
			For your assurance we will send you a mail that contains your idea id to be sure you are able to obtain the id at any time from your inbox. Without your id we can’t provide access to your idea centre.
			</p>

			<h2>how do i get in touch with the idea creator?</h2>
			<p> Just use the tag cloud on the right hand side of the web site to browse through our categories. If you found some interesting idea that you might help to come true don't hesitate to contact the owner of this idea. He will be noticed of your message and might be responding to you.</p>

			<h2>How does the idea centre work?</h2>
			<p>(fill me with something useful)</p>
		</article>
		<article id="uniqueness">
			<h1>what’s the unique feature of idea cloud?</h1>
			<p>Good question like there are several places on the web that can be used for sharing ideas with other human beings.
			<br />
			Some places are focused on the project itself like sourceforge or google hosting service where you have to create a project base first. Others are part of communities like the myriads of message boards where you can interact. Also you can also easily use facebook or twitter to post an idea and get help.
			<br /><br />
			But if you try these places you will soon recognize that they are one step ahead. None of them is used with the focus on the idea itself. They are all focused on the upcoming project that is needed to realize an idea.
			<br />
			This is what we think is the uniqueness of the idea cloud. Idea cloud is focused on the idea and the collecting of ideas. We tried hard to provide an easy to use interface for sharing ideas and browsing through existent ones.
			<br />
			</p>
			<h2>To speak clear of the advantages:</h2>
			
			<ul>
				<li>plain, simple user interface </li>
				<li>focus on the idea itself </li>
				<li>idea center to protect the idea posters privacy </li>
				<li>easy browsing through existing ideas for getting inspiration </li>
			</ul>
			<p>We hope you give it a try.</p>
